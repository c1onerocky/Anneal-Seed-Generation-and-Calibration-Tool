Post Divergence Trajectory Synthesis Model Seed Module

A lightweight probabilistic trajectory model.  Tracks low entropy motion paths through synthetic environments. This instance is used to replicate and recreated seeds based off intial conditions.  The output from the selected seed is the models base state.  based on the type of event which occurs when the seed was ran.  Gives insights into possible use case.  Secondary function: used as a calibration tool when changes cause catastrophic failure. (this instance is not tuned to solve trajectories, but a calibration tool to be used in conjunction with Anneal V1 and beyond.


Main:

Minimal neural skeleton capable of representing complex trajectory divergence using, branch based latent representations. 
Designed for research, experimentation, and forward exploration.


Features:

Ultra-lightweight
suitable for low resource, rapid iteration, zero issues running on CPU, GPU, Clusters. Legacy hardware included.

Branching superposition
Multi branch latent trajectories allow modeling divergence and uncertainty without large attention mechanisms.

Low human bias
Focused on probabilistic motion rather than human language or task specific outputs.

Residual consistency
residual layers ensure stable propagation of latent states.

Complexified latent representation Real + imaginary components allow uncertainty tracking and low-entropy pathing.

Time embeddings
Fourier features + linear projections encode continuous-time dynamics.

Readout to 3D space
Converts latent trajectories into observable 3D positions.

Installation
(Windows + AMD GPU via ZLUDA)

Install Python >=3.10

Install PyTorch 
(CPU or CUDA via ZLUDA)

Bash
pip install torch torchvision
     (amd)
Add ZLUDA DLLs to your system PATH

 

Notes

•The model is a skeleton, though the model is Tuned.  The tuning is not there to solve anything.  Meant to be used in conjunction with ANNEAL V1 and beyond for calibration. 

•Forward pass demonstrates latent motion propagation.

•Suitable for small synthetic datasets or experimental trajectory inputs.

•Designed to allow exploration of low-entropy trajectories without attention layers or human bias.
